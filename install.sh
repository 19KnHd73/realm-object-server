ðŸŽ‰    Realm Object Server is now installed!

When using Realm Object Server, remember to load the proper Node.js version
into your shell:

    nvm use ${node_version}

Here are some quick-start commands:

    ros start            # Start ROS with defaults
    ros init my-ros      # Initialize a new custom ROS project
    ros help             # Print usage information

EOD

if [ "${nvm_installed}" = "1" ]; then
    cat - <<-EOD
!!!! NOTICE !!!!

We have installed NVM, The NodeJS Version Manager for you. In order to continue, you will
need to inject NVM into your current shell.  You do so by running:

    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm

Enjoy! 
EOD
